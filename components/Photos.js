                <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg">Our team is committed to supplying you with the best quality of wood for your pergolas. The kits you can purchase from us are made from Free of Heart Center and Douglar Fir woods. Since this timber is meant for outdoors, you can be sure that it has natural resistance to insects and rotting. To give the wood products a lovely finishing, we use oil-based stains on them.</p>
